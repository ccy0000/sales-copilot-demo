# Pre-call Copilot

##Overview ðŸ’­
This repository showcases a conversational AI Copilot, developed using Relevance AI, designed to empower sales representatives with cutting-edge pre-call research and report generation capabilities. By harnessing web data, this agent ensures sales reps are exceptionally well-prepared, fostering stronger client relationships and boosting conversion rates.

##Purpose ðŸŽ¯
The primary purpose of this Copilot is to act as a personal research assistant for sales reps, creating highly relevant pre-call reports. It automates the tedious task of gathering data on prospects and their companies from across the web, consolidating it into actionable insights that reps can use before every call.

##Value Proposition ðŸ’°
This Copilot delivers significant value by directly impacting sales efficiency and effectiveness:

-Builds Instant Trust: When sales representatives demonstrate deep knowledge about a prospect and their company, it immediately builds rapport and trust, as the prospect feels genuinely valued and prepared for.
-Uncovers Selling Angles: The comprehensive research provided can reveal unique insights and effective selling angles that might otherwise be missed, allowing reps to tailor their pitch for maximum impact.
-Increases Conversion Rates: Better preparation, enhanced trust, and optimized selling strategies collectively lead to a higher conversion rate for the sales team, directly impacting revenue.
-Saves Time & Resources: Automating research frees up valuable time for sales reps to focus on core selling activities rather than manual data collection.

##Usage Workflow ðŸŽ¬
This Copilot is designed for quick and efficient use, seamlessly integrating into a sales rep's pre-call routine:

-Initiate Call Prep (10 mins before call): The sales rep opens the agentâ€™s URL (this very demo page!) and quickly checks their calendar to identify the prospect they are about to speak with.
-Company Research: The rep provides the company URL (e.g., https://example.com/), and the Copilot instantly retrieves and summarizes key company information from across the web.
-Prospect Research: The rep then provides the prospect's LinkedIn URL, and the Copilot gathers relevant professional insights about the individual.
-Generate Pre-Call Report: Finally, the rep simply asks the agent to "generate a pre-call report," and a concise, actionable summary is created, ready for the rep to review before taking the call.
